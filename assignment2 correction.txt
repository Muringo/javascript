
Difference between declaration,definition and initialization.

Declaration. 
Is the variable registered using a given name within the corresponding scope.

Definition.
Its showing how something has been implemented like a variable(var),or class of function.

Initialzation.
When you declare variable it is automatically initialized,which means memory is allocated for the variable by the javascript engine.
                     example:var n; 
                                // Declaration and iniialization.
                             var n= "Lucie";
                             Where my variable registered is (var n) and the name given is Lucie.
